# Forecasting the Weather in NYC
This is the repository for a group project I completed as part of CIS 9660 (Data Mining for Business Analytics) at Baruch College as part of my master's degree in Information Systems/Data Analytics. Our goal was to predict the weather in New York City, which was a challenging task.

**Values Predicted**
- Temperature (predict value)
- Precipitation
  - Classification - raining/not raining?
  - Regression - amount of precipitation

**Models Created**
- Temperature regression tree and boosted tree (XGBoost)
- Precipitation regression tree and boosted tree
- Linear regression for temperature
- Logistic regression and tree-model classification for precipitation
- Facebook Prophet time series forecast
